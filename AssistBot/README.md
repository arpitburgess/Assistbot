**Project: AssistBot - Personalized Desk Assistant**
*Description*: AssistBot is a Python-based project developed to provide a personalized and interactive desk assistant experience. Leveraging computer vision and natural language processing, it initiates conversations, offers assistance through voice interactions, and recognizes users by name.

*Technologies*: Python, gTTS, OpenAI, PyAudio, Pygame, OpenCV, Raspberry Pi

*Responsibilities*:
- Solely Led the development of the AssistBot project from concept to implementation.
- Utilized computer vision techniques with OpenCV to detect user presence through a webcam.
- Integrated gTTS for voice output and PyAudio for voice input, enabling interactive conversations.
- Incorporated OpenAI's natural language processing capabilities to understand and respond to user queries.
- Designed the user recognition system to identify users by name, enhancing the personalized experience.

*Accomplishments*:
- Successfully created a functional prototype of AssistBot, demonstrating its ability to initiate conversations and provide assistance.
- Achieved seamless integration of various libraries to enable natural and intuitive interactions.
- Implemented an efficient user recognition system that enhances user engagement and personalization.

*Challenges*:
- Overcame technical challenges related to integrating multiple libraries and ensuring compatibility.
- Addressed user recognition accuracy through iterative testing and refinement.

This project showcases my ability to combine computer vision, natural language processing, and Python programming to create a functional and personalized desk assistant.
